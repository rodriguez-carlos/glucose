# Glucose

Glucose is an action minigame where the player controls a synthetic insulin molecule (represented by a robot) and escapes from glucose molecules (represented by zombies). In future builds, the player will activate insulin receptors which are turrets that attack glucose molecules through various mechanisms (shooting, electricity fields, TBD).

### Player Controls

Use WASD to move the robot around. Side keys provide rotation. Player has three animations: Idle, walking, and rotating in place. Stand near a DNA column to obtain HP from it.

### Enemy Behavior

The glucose (zombies) have three animations: Idle, walking, and running. When approached by player, they will start walking toward it, and when really close, they will run to catch them. Once caught up to player, zombie will stop running to initiate attacks (missing feature).

### DNA Columns

The world has a sort of sombre atmosphere, and DNA columns are the main source of light (this feature is to be adjusted in future iterations). DNA columns also provide the player with healing (which glucose zombies will have damaged), but they have limited HP stock. When run out, the DNA column will disappear along with its light, making the world darker.

### Nerve Columns

This type of column will provide the player with communication features in future iterations of the game.
